This is a simple web-based OPL3 manager that uses [opljs](https://github.com/Malvineous/opljs).

You can upload/download imf files, and play with the params.

The purpose of this is to setup presets for use with real chips, and eventually I will hopefully have a way to download them directly to a synth (chip, connected to a real chip, using USB, midi sysex, or something else.)
